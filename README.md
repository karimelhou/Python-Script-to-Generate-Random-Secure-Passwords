# Python-Script-to-Generate-Random-Secure-Passwords
This script can be used to generate random, secure passwords in Python. 
It takes user input in the form of a desired password length and then randomly generates a password of that length using a combination of upper and 
lower case alphanumeric characters. The script also ensures that the generated password is secure by implementing additional measures such as checking 
for repetition of characters, ensuring the presence of at least one number, and using a cryptographically secure random number generator.
